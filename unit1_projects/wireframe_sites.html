		<h1>WIREFRAME FOR SNOWBOARDERMAG.COM</h1>
		<p>The problem that www.snowboardermag.com is solving is giving people up-to-date information on snowboarding and the happenings within the snowboarding community.  Like ESPN or any sports network displays up-to-date information on mainstream sports on television, snowboardermag.com is accomplishing this same goal through the web.  At the same time it is an outlet for companies within the industry as well as athlete sponsors to advertise their brands as well as athlete's to the world.  Snowboardermag.com is a way for people with a common interest to share and connect with each other to keep up with the latest athletic feats as well as trends in the sport.  The problem being solved is that people are able to go to snowboardermag.com and see videos/photos/news of there favorite athlete's and the gear that they wear while using it to further promote those athletes and the companies they represent.</p>
		<p>The visual challenges to me are the overcrowding of images and the lack of text diversity to make any particular element stand out over the rest.  To me there does not seem to be a main focal point outside of the navigation bar other than the photo's which change often.  Everytime you come back to the site, visually it has changed, making it a new experience as well as challenge to navigate each time it is visited.  Since this site is largely based on photos and screenshots from videos it is hard to make it consistent with the updates that are necessary.  I see this as more of a blog than anything, which means updates are obviously constant.</p>
