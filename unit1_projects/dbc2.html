				<p>Hello and welcome to my page about snowboarding.  Snowboarding truly begain in the 1970's with people like Tom Sims and Jake Burton.  They created their own snowboards out of things that they were able to find in school and at home.  Early snowboards were basically pieces of wood with makeshift bindings attached to them.  The first bindings were usually made of ropes to tie their feet to the boards.  Not long after this snowboarding competitions began!  Nowadays Snowboarding is one of the top extreme sports and is now even an olympic event.
