My plan for my new index.html page is to have an artistic theme with a lot of visual imagery.  I want my index.html page to grab the user's attention through photos.  The top will have a clean, centered, navigation bar with a large header font to make it clear where you are at.  This is a blog of course about myself so I want users to feel as if they have a sense of who I am from the first page they visit.  The main content area I will have centered with 85% width of the page.
