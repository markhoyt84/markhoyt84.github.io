                <h3>Reflections</h3>
                <p>Working with a pair for the first time in a guided pairing session was a great experience for myself and I think Dustin as well!  I think we both enjoyed it and worked very well as a team together.  We both took several turns 'driving' and 'navigating'.  This strategy worked very well for us and both of us were able to show our strengths and areas to work on.  Dustin was very good with fluid layouts and was able to help me gain a much greater understanding of how to set up a fluid design. Our communication was great and I think we were able to accomplish a lot in short amount of time.  Paired programming seems like a very great practice to me and I look forward to a lot more pairing while in DBC as well as in my career in the future.</p>
