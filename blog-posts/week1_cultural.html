			<h1>Cultural Blog!  My interpretation of the DBC way of learning!</h1>
				<p>After watching <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef's Fireside Chat</a> I felt very empowered and excited for the experience that we are all about to share.  I think that what Shereef has created is an amazing experiment of people working together to begin to master the art of programming.  This out-of-the-norm way of teaching I feel is going to be an incredibly productive new-age way of teaching.  After watching the video I feel that DEV Bootcamp is not for everyone and that it takes a special kind of thinker/learner to be successful within this community.  Shereef's way of learning focuses on a team environment where people aren't afraid to ask for help as well as ask how they can help others.  Dev Bootcamp asks not only what they can do for you but what you can contribute to them as well as the whole programming community.  There is no right-or-wrong asnwers, just a desire to learn and create.  Intelligence is not the fundamental tool at DEV Bootcamp but persistance, teamwork, and the ability to accept that you don't have all the answers but are willing to put in the extra effort to find them are some of them.</p>
				<p>I feel as though this will be a perfect learning environment for myself and most of my other classmates that I have met so far.  This is not a competition between us but an experience to better us as individuals and as a team.  I feel as though once we are done with DEV Bootcamp we will have better social skills and a greater emotional intelligence to succeed in not only the workplace but in all aspects of our lives.</p>
				<p>My expecations of DBC have grown tremendously, but not in a sense of just what they can do for myself, but what I can add to the class/community myself.  Working with others has always been a strong point of mine and DBC I feel also strongly supports the idea that two-brains is better than one.  My hope is that the other students feel as strongly about this team environment as I do and are all willing to work together to succeed.  Overall I am very excited to dive into this kind of learning environment as well as the work environment that will follow!  Just like with snowboarding, there is no one correct way to program, learning from others and getting inspiration from others work/accomplishments is an amazing way to improve your own abilities.  I truly believe in the DBC method and am excited and feel very privileged to be a part of this community and experience!</p>
